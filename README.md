# MarketingCampaign
Marketing Campaign Project using Kaggle data (https://www.kaggle.com/rodsaldanha/arketing-campaign)

This is my first project posted onto Github. It is simply an exploratory data analysis looking at who the customers are, what they are buying, where they are buying, and if the marketing promotions worked. I also was in general comparing the pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn packages. I am not done this this analysis: I have figure formating and coloring to finish (prettifying (not the bs4 kind) to do) and some deeper questions to answer, but I wanted to go ahead and post it so I can use the handy dandy versioning that exists in github.
